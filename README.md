# Developer-Portfolio

This is my personal web developer portfolio which created to showcase my skills as a front-end web developer. it will contain all current and future projects developed by me and will be a place for prospective employers to look through what I've done.
The website is very simple and easy to use without any complex features and provides a easy way for people to get in contact if needed through the contact form.



## Development
The development of this project has shown me the importance of careful planning from not only things such as layout but to colour choices and typography. The website was created with a mobile first approach which made things easier because the site goes from developing for smaller view ports to larger ones.

3. #00153d - used for footer background.

## Testing

1. All hyperlinks open to the correct location.
2. when changing viewport size the website nav bar changes to a hamburger menu and all fits within the design of the page.
3. Tested the contact form but doesn't clear input fields once page the formspree go back button is cleared. 

## Deployment

This project has been deployed using GitHub pages which is the platform which i have used to showcase my portfolio. During production I've been constantly committing any changes big or small to my repository by using the push method. The current version at deployment is a stable one but can do with some improvements in terms of structural and visual layouts. Therefore, I plan on updating the code, so it includes bootstraps grid layout. This was something I came to understand at a later stage of development.
